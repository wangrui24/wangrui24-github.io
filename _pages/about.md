I am a PhD student in Biostatistics, University of Washington. I am working with Dr. Fei Gao as a research assistant at the Fred Hutch Cancer Center.

Prior to coming to UW, I obtained my master degree from the Peking University. I hold bachelor degrees in medicine and economics from Peking University. I am interested in causal inference, and its applications in public health and social science.

I am originally from a small town Anhui province, Eastern China. When not working, I enjoy playing tennis, watching movies and spending time with friends.

You can find my full publication list on [my Google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OZeSbMEAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN).
